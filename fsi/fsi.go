// Package fsi defines qri file system integration: representing a dataset as
// files in a directory on a user's computer. Using fsi, users can edit files
// as an interface for working with qri datasets.
//
// A dataset is "linked" to a directory through a `.qri_ref` dotfile that
// connects the folder to a version history stored in the local qri repository.
//
// files in a linked directory follow naming conventions that map to components
// of a dataset. eg: a file named "meta.json" in a linked directory maps to
// the dataset meta component. This mapping can be used to construct a dataset
// for read and write actions
